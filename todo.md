### Short-term

You will be the world's greatest Python programmer by the time we are done. Promise. And that is no bad thing:

### Long term

This subject is a bet on the future of SE. 

In  traditional manual software engineering, engineers laboriously convert (by hand) non-executable paper models into executable code. 
That traditional process has been the focus of much research.  

This subject  is about a new kind of SE which relies, at least in part, on executable models. 
In this approach, engineers codify the current understanding of the domain into a model, 
and then study those models.
Many of these models are delivered as part of working systems.
So much so that these models now
  mediate nearly all aspects of our lives:

+ If you
  live in London or New York and need to call an
  ambulance, that ambulance is waiting for your call
  at a location pre-determined by a model. 
+ If you cross from Mexico to Arizona,
a biometrics model  decides if you need
secondary screening.
+  The power to make your toast comes from a
  generator that was spun-up in response
  to some model predicting your future electrical
  demands.
+ If you fly a plane, extensive
  model-based software controls many aspects of
  flight, including what to do in emergency
  situations.
+ If you have a heart attack, the
   models in the defibrillator will
  decide how to shock your heart and lungs so that
  you might live a little longer.

Given recent advances in computing hardware, software analysts either validate these models or 
find optimal solutions by using automatic tools to explore thousands to millions of inputs for their systems. 
Note that such tools work much faster  than humans.  
Valerdi notes that, without automated tools, it can take days for human experts to review just a few dozen examples~\cite{valerdi11}.  
In that same time, an automatic tool can explore thousands to millions to billions more solutions.
